# Overview

This is a simple Todo List application built using AngularJS
and Gulp.  You must have NPM installed to build and run the
project locally.

## Quick Start

You can start up a local web server serving the app by running
`npm install`, `npm start` and opening the URL `localhost:8000`
in a web browser.


## Installation

To install dependencies:
```
npm install
```


## Perform One-Time Build

To perform a one-time build:
```
gulp build
```
Ready-to-deploy artifacts will be placed in the  `./build` directory.


## Run on Server

To run a livereloading dev server on port 8000:
```
npm start
```
This dev server will watch for changes in any JS, HTML, or SASS files
and automatically build and reload the app in the browser window.
